# MorphoLogic
MorphoLogic extracts comprehensive neuronal morphometrics from 2D SWC reconstructions and can perform morphology-aware mapping to project concurrent microscopy signals or (synaptic) puncta onto reconstructed neurons. Outputs include per-cell diagnostic visualizations and per-dataset aggregated CSV tables spanning multilevel summaries.
